# Project2

The ToolTracker application that helps keep track of inventory of tools that are being checked out by a user.

ToolTracker records the user name, price, tool, quantity, and the time and date of when a tool has been checked out.

With the layout of the page, bootstrap and css were used together with Handlebars.

ToolTracker uses a database of 10 tools.
We have used mysql to makeup the database.

The Node applications that we used are
npm install
Es Lint
Nodemon to keep the node server at a constant run.
